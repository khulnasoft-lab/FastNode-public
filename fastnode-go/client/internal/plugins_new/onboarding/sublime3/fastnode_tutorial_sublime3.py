""" Fastnode is your programming copilot. Fastnode will try to show you the
    right information at the right time as you code to prevent you from context
    switching out of your current line of thought.

    This tutorial will teach you how to use all of Fastnode's core features. You
    should be able to learn everything in 5 minutes.

""" PYTHON TUTORIAL ============================================================

    Not writing Python? Open tutorials for other languages by running the
    following commands from the command palette:

    * For Javascript, run   "Fastnode: Javascript Tutorial"
    * For Go, run           "Fastnode: Go Tutorial"
"""


""" PART 0: BEFORE WE START ====================================================

    Fastnode's Sublime package will by default try to start the Fastnode backend when
    the editor first starts. You can change this behavior by opening the Fastnode
    package's settings, and changing "start_fastnode_engine_on_startup".

    Look for the ùïúùïöùï•ùïñ symbol in the bottom left corner of Sublime's status
    bar ‚Äî It will tell you if Fastnode is ready and working. If the indicator reads
    "Connection error", then you'll have to start the Fastnode Engine manually
    before proceeding with the rest of this tutorial.
"""




""" PART 1: CODE COMPLETIONS ===================================================

    Fastnode analyzes your code and uses machine learning to show you completions
    for what you're going to type next.

    If you have your editor configured to show autocompletions, then Fastnode will
    show you completions automatically as you type.

    If you don't have autocompletions on, you can press ctrl+space to request
    completions at any time.

    You can toggle autocompletions by changing Sublime's native "auto_complete"
    setting to true or false.

    Look for Fastnode's "‚ü†" symbol on the right-hand side to see which completions
    are coming from Fastnode.
"""


# 1a. Conflicting packages
#
# If you have other 3rd party packages which provide completions, your
# experience with Fastnode may not be ideal because these packages may conflict
# with Fastnode's behavior. We suggest temporarily disabling completions from other
# packages while you try out Fastnode. You won't be disappointed!


# 1b. Name completions
#
# Fastnode can suggest names of symbols to use, such as names of packages or names
# of variables in scope.

# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
# ‚Ä¢¬†Type "s" and select the completion for "json". (The rest of this tutorial
#   depends on you doing so!)
# ‚Ä¢ Remember to press ctrl+space if autocompletions aren't on.

import j  # <--


# 1c. Attribute completions
#
# Type a "." after a name and Fastnode will show you the attributes available.

# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Put your cursor at the end line of the line marked with "<--".
# ‚Ä¢ Type "." and select the completion for "dumps".
# ‚Ä¢¬†Remember to press ctrl+space if autocompletions aren't on.

json  # <--


# 1d. Code completions on demand
#
# Remember that you can use a keyboard shortcut at any time to request code
# completions.

# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
# ‚Ä¢ Press ctrl+space to request code completions to see the attributes in the
#   json module.

json.  # <--




""" PART 2: FUNCTION ASSIST ====================================================

    Fastnode can also show you how to use a function as you're calling it in your
    code.

    By default, Fastnode will show you this information automatically as you're
    coding when it detects that your cursor is inside a function call.

    You can prevent this UI from being shown automatically by changing Fastnode's
    "show_function_signatures" setting to false.

    You can manually request function assist at any time by pressing
    ctrl+alt+u. However, your cursor must be inside a function call for the UI
    to appear.

    You can hide the function assist UI by pressing escape.
"""


# 2a. Function signatures and more
#
# When you're calling a function, Fastnode will show you the function's signature
# to help you remember what arguments you need to pass in. It may also show you
# examples of how other developers use the function and the keyword arguments
# you can use.

# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Put your cursor at the end of line marked with "<--".
# ‚Ä¢ Type "(" to start the function call, and Fastnode will show you how to call
#   json.dumps.
# ‚Ä¢ Remember to press ctrl+alt+u after typing "(" if you've disabled function
#   assist from happening automatically.
#
# ‚Ä¢ Within the UI, click on the "Examples" link to see how other developers use
#   the function.
# ‚Ä¢ You can hide this information by clicking on the "Hide" link.

json.dumps  # <--


# 2b. Learning from your own code
#
# Fastnode will also show you signatures, example usages, and keyword arguments for
# functions that you have defined in your own code.

# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
# ‚Ä¢ Type "(" to get assistance for your locally defined pretty_print function.
# ‚Ä¢ Remember to press ctrl+alt+u after typing "(" if you've disabled function
#   assist from happening automatically.

def pretty_print(obj, indent=2):
    print(json.dumps(obj, indent=indent))

pretty_print(obj, indent=4)

pretty_print  # <--


# 2c. Function assist on demand
#
# Remember that you can use a keyboard shortcut at any time to view information
# about a function.

# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Put your cursor between the "(" and ")" on the line marked with "<--".
# ‚Ä¢ Press ctrl+alt+u to access function assist.

pretty_print()  # <--



""" PART 3: INSTANT DOCUMENTATION ==============================================

    Fastnode can also show you documentation for the symbols in your code.

    If Fastnode's "show_hover" setting is true, then you can access documentation
    by hovering your mouse over a symbol and then clicking the "Docs" link.

    Otherwise, you can also position your cursor over a symbol, and then press
    ctrl+alt+d to access documentation.
"""


# TRY IT
# ------
# ‚Ä¢ Hover your mouse over "dumps" and then click "Docs".
# ‚Ä¢¬†Or put your cursor over "dumps" and then press ctrl+alt+d.
