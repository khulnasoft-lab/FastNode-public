/*  Fastnode is your programming copilot. Fastnode will try to show you the right
    information at the right time as you code to prevent you from context
    switching out of your current line of thought.

    This tutorial will teach you how to use all of Fastnode's core features. You
    should be able to learn everything in 5 minutes.

    If you get stuck at any point, please visit https://help.khulnasoft.com/ or file
    an issue at https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/issue-tracker.

/*  JAVASCRIPT TUTORIAL ========================================================

    Not writing Javascript? Open tutorials for other languages by running the
    following commands from the command palette:

    * For Python, run       "Fastnode: Python Tutorial"
    * For Go, run           "Fastnode: Go Tutorial"
*/


/*  BEFORE WE START ============================================================

    Fastnode's VS Code extension will by default try to start the Fastnode backend when
    the editor first starts. You can change this behavior by opening settings,
    searching for "Fastnode:", and changing "Fastnode: Start Fastnode Engine On Startup".

    Look for the 𝕜𝕚𝕥𝕖 indicator in the bottom right corner of VS Code's status
    bar — It will tell you if Fastnode is ready and working. If the indicator reads
    "not running", then you'll have to start the Fastnode Engine manually before
    proceeding with the rest of this tutorial.
*/


/*  CODE COMPLETIONS ===========================================================

    Fastnode analyzes your code and uses machine learning to show you completions
    for what you're going to type next.

    If you have your editor configured to show autocompletions, then Fastnode will
    show you completions automatically as you type.

    If you don't have autocompletions on, you can press ctrl+space to request
    completions at any time.

    You can toggle autocompletions in the editor settings by changing
    "Editor: Suggest On Trigger Characters".

    Look for a stylized 𝕜𝕚𝕥𝕖 on the right-hand side to see which completions
    are coming from Fastnode.


    TRY IT =====================================================================

    Let's write out an import statement for React.

    • Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
    • Type "R" here for completions to help you finish this import statement:

    import React, { Component } from 'react';
*/


import     // <-- type a space and "R"


/*
    Fastnode's Line-of-Code completions can predict multiple words ahead of what
    you're going to type next. They show up after a space as well, without
    you typing anything.
*/


/*  CODE COMPLETIONS ON DEMAND =================================================

    Remember that you can use the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+space" at any time to
    request code completions.


    TRY IT =====================================================================

    Let's declare a class "Button" that extends "Component"

    • Put your cursor at the end of the line marked with "<--".
    • Press ctrl+space to request code completions.
    • Look for the completion with a line break icon. Text after this icon is
    inserted on the line below.

    Start off your class like this:

    class Button extends Component {
      render()
    }
*/

class Button extends C     // <-- press ctrl+space after "C"


/*
    Fastnode's Multi-line completions recognize that a line break is suitable and
    starts writing your next line of code.
*/


/*  That's it!

    Now you know how to use Fastnode's core features to boost your productivity as
    you code. You can access this tutorial at any time by running the command
    "Fastnode: Javascript Tutorial" from the command palette.
