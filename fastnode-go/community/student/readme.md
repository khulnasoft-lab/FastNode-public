## Student email test

We use Swot (https://github.com/JetBrains/swot) from JetBrains to test if an email address is in an academic domain. 

The file swot.txt contains the list of academic domains and a blacklist. 

The code in this package is adapted from the repo.


### Updating swot file

1. Clone the swot repo 
2. Download and install kotlin (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)
3. Compile the 2 files  with `kotlinc src/swot/Compiler.kt src/swot/Swot.kt -include-runtime -d swot.jar`
4. Execute it with `java -jar swot.jar` (from the same folder)
5. It should produce a file in `out/artifacts/swot.txt`
6. Copy this file in `khulnasoft-lab/fastnode-go/community/student/cmds/updatedomains` and execute this package. 
7. A new json.gz file will be produced, update the const `PathDomainList` in `student.go` to point to this new file.
