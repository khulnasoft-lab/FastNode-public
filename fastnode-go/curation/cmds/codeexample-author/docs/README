Overview
--------

curation.khulnasoft.com hosts static documents (such as style guides) at
<http://curation.khulnasoft.com/static/docs>.  The Markdown source for these docs is
stored in this directory.  The HTML files are rebuilt when the Curation site
is deployed, or when you run the build command manually.


Setup
-----

First install dependencies.  You'll need Node, whose installer you can
download from their website: <http://nodejs.org>.  Then run:

	$ cd khulnasoft-lab/fastnode-go/curation/cmds/codeexample-author
	$ npm install


Building Manually
-----------------

To build docs manually, run:

	$ npm run build-docs
