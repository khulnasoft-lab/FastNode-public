pythonresource Build Orchestration
==================================

## Setup

1. Use Linux. As of the time of writing of this document, `ubuntu@test-import.khulnasoft.com` has everything set up.
2. Install an up-to-date version of `go`. This will be used to build the binaries that will in turn build the datasets,
   so it should be a compatible with `khulnasoft-lab`. The default package available through your Linux distribution's package
   repository is almost certainly out of date. See these [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).
3. Clone a local copy of `github.com/khulnasoft-lab/fastnode` into your `$GOPATH` (defaults to `~/go`). You should probably use
   `go get` for this.
4. Install a recent version of [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) (some old versions
   have a bug that causes flaky builds). You'll also want to `sudo gpasswd -a <YOUR_USER> docker` and log out/in to
   allow your user to issue `docker` commands without `sudo`.
5. `docker login` with your hub.docker.com credentials.
6. Symlink `pythonresource/cmd/Makefile` into a build directory of your choosing (e.g. `~/build/`).


## Running an End-to-End Build

```
➜ make setup
➜ cp -p -u dockerfiles/all/* dockerfiles/build/
➜ nohup 2>&1 make -j32 -k -d build &
➜ tail -f nohup.log
 ...
 ...
```

Note that we use `make -j32 -k`. `-j32` uses 32 worker processes to parallelize the build; `-k` instructs `make` not to
exit until it has built as much as possible.

## How It Works

There are two phases to the build: `make setup` and `make build`. `make` will print the contents of this usage guide.

#### Setup

`make setup` will build the `dockertools` binary to generate and output Dockerfiles used for pkgexploration to
`dockerfiles/all`. See the following resultant directory structure:

```
build/
  bin/
    dockertools
dockerfiles/
  build/
  all/
    requests__2.18.4
    ...
```

`make setup` also creates an empty `dockerfiles/build/` directory. The subsequent build step will read files from
here, so it is the user's job to copy over the relevant Dockerfiles. This is a simple way of marking packages for
exploration.

Note that `make` will use the modified timestamps of the files to decide what to rebuild, so it is recommended to use
`cp -p` which will maintain timestamps. Additionally, `make setup`/`dockertools` will not overwrite files that already
exist in `dockerfiles/all/`, so a file must be deleted before regeneration.

#### Build

See the following directory layout produced by a full build:

```
dockerfiles/
  build/
    %
build/
  bin/
  dockerimages/         markers for built docker images and logs produced by the docker build
    BASE
    BASE.log
    %.image
    %.image.log

  explored/
    %.json              raw explored graphs
    %.log               logs generated during exploration in the docker container
    %.json.log          logs generated outside the docker container by dockertools
  rawgraph/
    %.valid.json        sanitized and validated graphs
    %.valid.json.log

  data/                 where final resource datafiles are written by the builders
  symgraphs/            per-package resource manifests each pointing at the single symgraph datafile for that package
    %.json
    %.json.log
  symtypes/             similarly per-package resource manifests
    %.json
    %.json.log
  argspecs/             similarly per-package resource manifests
    %.json
    %.json.log

  symgraphs.json        the result of merging all generated symgraphs/%.json manifests
  symtypes.json         similarly merging symtypes/%.json
  argspecs.json         similarly merging argspecs/%.json
  typeshed.json
  docs.json
  sigpatterns.json

  typeshed/             clone of typeshed git repository
  base.json             a copy of the manifest in your copy of khulnasoft-lab
  merged_graph.json     the result of merging symgraphs.json onto base.json (see below)

  manifest.json         manifest for all newly generated resource data, on top of base.json
  distidx.json
  compat.json.gz
```

`make build` will build `manifest.json`, which will cause everything to get built. Here, `manifest.json` will add all
built datafiles to the `base.json` manifest, which is by default copied directly out of `khulnasoft-lab`. This allows
incremental builds. Manually writing this file before building allows for customization. For example,
`touch build/base.json` will use an empty manifest as base.

Note that the base manifest used is important when building the distidx, docs, etc, since those builders load the
entire symbol graph in order to produce their output. Therefore, `base.json` should really be such that the resultant
`manifest.json` can be deployed as-is. Usually, the default is fine.

Similarly, bypassing other parts of the build is possible by manually `touch`ing the appropriate files. For example, to
bypass building typeshed data, `touch build/typeshed.json` will create an empty manifest that will cause no changes when
merged into the base.

For more complex builds, and in order to generally understand the dependency graph, please read through the `Makefile`.


#### Updating the bindata

Once you've created your final manifest (e.g. `manifest_merged.json`), copy it and `distidx.json` to `fastnode-go/lang/python/pythonresource/manifest.json` and `fastnode-go/lang/python/pythonresource/index.json`, respectively. Then run `go generate ./fastnode-go/lang/python/pythonresource/internal/manifest` and `go generate ./fastnode-go/lang/python/pythonresource/internal/distidx` to generate the bindata.

#### Past Runs

Data from past runs of pkgexploration lives on `pythonresource.khulnasoft.com` and the `pythonresource` GCP instance.

#### `msgp`

We use MessagePack as the serialization format for some resources,
as the `msgp` library allows for very efficient deserialization.
There are more efficient options, but `msgp` is at the sweet spot
of ergonomic, customizable, and efficient.

See `symgraphs` and `popularsignatures` for examples.

Normally, we would have to change various structs in many different packages to be
serializable via `msgp`, which would involve making private fields public,
modifying the struct tags, and scattering `go generate` in many places.

To avoid this, we create "structural analog" types in the resource directory,
instead of using the external type as the resource type. These types
are structurally identical to the external ones, and thus can be safely
casted to the external type when needed.

In order to ensure that the types remain structural analogs (which is critical to avoid
memory corruption issues at runtime), we write `cast_test.go` files that use
`fastnode-golib/reflection.StructurallyEqual` to verify this property.
