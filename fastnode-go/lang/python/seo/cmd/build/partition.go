// TODO(naman) we may also want to do more deduping based on docstring collision,
// but this is a bit complicated

// The raw number of candidates for removal based on a naive deduper is ~50k.

// This technique seems to potentially yields many false positives: there is a risk of accidentally merging too much.
// One approach might be to only merge in cases where all the matching symbols are in the same distribution:
//
// With this filter there are ~24k remaining candidates for removal.

// However, even then, there is almost never a clear candidate for the "canonical" symbol.
// Symbol counts tend to all be approximately even, and the shortest path tends not to be (close to) unique:
// most of the colliding symbols are usually of approximately equal length.
//
// If we only look at cases where there's a clear shortest path, only ~2.5k candidates remain for removal.

// This needs more thought overall, but it's unclear whether it's worth the time investment.
