# Should shingles cross over underscores?

$date

## Background

We compare two approaches of transforming words with underscores into shingles.

For the control, we convert a word into shingles by finding any five consecutive letters.
So `foobar` becomes two shingles: `fooba` and `oobar`.
And `foo_barbaz` also becomes two shingles: `barba` and `arbaz`.

For the treatment, we also allow shingles which span across underscores.
So `foobar` still becomes two shingles: `fooba` and `oobar`.
But `foo_barbaz` becomes five shingles: `fooba`, `oobar`, `obarb`, `barba`, and `arbaz`.

## Instructions

To reproduce the experiment: `make all`

## Validation

### Control

$control_validation

### Treatment

$treatment_validation

## Examples

Note: these are cherry-picked examples, not random samples.

For the treatment and control, we get recommendations based on the current path.
We find the ranking (1-based) of the related path and call that the "related path rank".
We find the highest scoring keywords from the related path.

## Conclusion

We should switch to the treatment, because:
- The overall validation metrics are marginally better.
- We know of several interesting examples where the treatment performs significantly better.
