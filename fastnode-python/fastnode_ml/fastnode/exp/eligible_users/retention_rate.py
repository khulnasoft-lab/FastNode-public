    """
    Returns a function that can calculate the "true retention" rate given a DataFrame of daily user counts by cohort
       (e.g. as returned by counts_for_daily_cohort())

    For the motivation behind finding the true retention rate, see:
        https://fastnode.quip.com/TJxqAJs7vz05/Eligible-Users
    ...but the gist of it is that we want to find out the rate at which eligible users (i.e. those who are Python
    coders who use a Fastnode-supported editor) retain.

    To achieve this, we begin with the assumption that when looking at just the numbers from fastnode_status events,
    our categorization of dormant and lost users may be incorrect (due to the fact that it may count ineligible users,
    or issues with collecting metrics).

    To fix this, we look at the results of the Windows user survey:
        https://fastnode.quip.com/DgfvAoP0WOma/Windows-User-Survey

    This survey includes questions about the last time a user coded in Python and the last time a user coded using
    Fastnode. From these we can determine whether a user is truly lost or dormant, at least if we take that user's survey
    responses at face value.

    We then calculate the fractions of:
    - lost (categorized by us) respondents who claim to have used Python but not Fastnode within the past <active_days>
        (lost_lost_rate)
    - lost (categorized by us) survey respondents who claim to have used both Fastnode and Python within the past
        <active_days> (lost_active_rate)
    - dormant (categorized by us) survey respondents who claim to have used Python but not Fastnode within the past
        <active_days> (dormant_lost_rate)
    - dormant (categorized by us) survey respondents who claim to have used Python but not Fastnode within the past
        <active_days> (dormant_active_rate)

    We then apply corrections to the retention rate by redistributing our lost and dormant users according to these
    calculated rates, using the assumption that this rate holds for every measured cohort.

    active_users =
        active_count + (dormant_count * dormant_active_rate) + (lost_count * lost_active_rate)

    churned_users =
        (dormant_count * dormant_lost_rate) + (lost_count * lost_lost_rate)

    true_retention_rate = active_users / (active_users + churned_users)
