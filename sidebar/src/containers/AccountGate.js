/** AccountGate acts as a wrapper for containers that
 *  require authentication to access.
 *  AccountGate is designed to be used declaratively as so:
 *
 *    <AccountGate>
 *      {
 *        a single component here which will be mounted
 *        if authentication succeeds
 *      }
 *    </AccountGate>
 *
 *  Alternatively, you may also pass in a function that
 *  returns a single component as the `children` prop if
 *  that is more convenient:
 *
 *    <AccountGate children={() => <div/>}/>
 *
 *  This function will not be evaluated until the account
 *  is authenticated
 *
 *  AccountGate when mounted will try to grab the account info
 *  and will boot to login screen if unauthenticated. It will also
 *  save the original path the user is trying to access and once
 *  authenticated, will push the user back to that path.
 *
 *  Child containers will not be mounted unless the user has been
 *  logged in.
