NSIS Patch Generation Utility v1.0.2
====================================

Changes:

Version 1.0.2
-------------

Release Date: 10/11/2007

+ Now use our own version of the VPathFile Macro. 
This fixes failures when PATCH_SOURCE_ROOT or PATCH_FILES_ROOT were absolute paths, or have spaces in them them.


Version 1.0.1
-------------

Release Date: 02/09/2007

+ Modified code to work with the new version of GenPat.exe due to changes in the command line parameter syntax.
This version of nsispatch gen requires Gen Pat 3.1. Any recent install of NSIS contains this.

+ Fixed bug where failure could occur if the root directories had similar names. e.g. c:\dir1 and c:\dir10

+ nsispatchgen can now be built with VisualStudio 2005 express. To build the unit tests qxrunner is needed as the test runner that comes with cppunit requires MFC.

+ NOTE: don't use Qt 4.3 to build nsispatch gen with as there is a bug where system files are not detected properly.


Version 1.0.0
-------------

Release Date: 09/05/2006

Initial Release
